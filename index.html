<h2>I create things for the web.</h2> 
    <p>I started creating things for the web when I was in middle school and realized everyone has the tools to make professional websites&mdash;they just need to learn how to use them. So I started teaching myself HTML and CSS, building my own web sites, and uploading them to the Internet.</p>

<p>When I worked as a clerk at a health food store, I offered to ramp up the store's web presence to help it compete in the digital age. By the time I left Healthy Alternatives, I was managing its social media pages as well as writing and producing a monthly newsletter. I increased newsletter subscriptions by 15% without decreasing engagement. I also developed a new, <a href="https://www.healthyalt.com/">mobile-friendly site</a> for the store.</p>

<p>In addition to using the Internet as my playground, I'm also passionate about making the world a better place. In fact, I got a degree in professional writing to learn how I could use my voice to help those less fortunate than me. I've put those skills to use with The Humane League, <a href="https://ragingchickenpress.org/author/lryan/">Raging Chicken Press</a>, and <a href="projects.html">more</a> throughout the years.</p>

<p>If you need someone who thrives on building things behind the scenes and has the organization skills to handle big projects, <a href="contact.html">I'd love to chat.</a></p>
